**üîß Embedded Systems Projects Using PIC Microcontroller**


This repository contains a collection of embedded systems projects developed using PIC microcontrollers, covering various core topics in microcontroller interfacing, peripheral programming, and real-time embedded control. Each folder represents a specific module or interface, showcasing real-time implementations with code, schematics (if any), and modular examples.

**üìÅ Repository Structure & Descriptions
Folder Name	Description**

**ADC**

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) implementation using PIC to read analog sensor values and convert them to digital form.

**ADC-PWM**

Combines ADC input and PWM output for applications like motor speed control or brightness control based on sensor input.


**I2C**	

I2C communication protocols implemented between PIC and other I2C-compatible devices like EEPROMs or sensors.


**INTERRUPT**	

Demonstrates usage of hardware interrupts in PIC (e.g., external interrupts, timer interrupts) for asynchronous event handling.


**KEYPAD_INTERFACE**	

Interfacing 4x4 matrix keypad with PIC microcontroller for capturing user input.


**LCD**	

Interfacing 16x2 alphanumeric LCD with PIC using either 4-bit or 8-bit mode to display data or messages.


**LED_BLINK**	

Basic LED blinking project to understand GPIO pin toggling using timers or delays.


**LED_SWITCH**

Interfacing push-button switches with LEDs. Demonstrates input detection and digital output control.


**MEMORY_MAPPING**

Demonstrates how to map and access memory locations in PIC for data manipulation or storage.


**PWM**	

Pulse Width Modulation generation using PIC timers. Useful for motor control, LED dimming, etc.


**RTC/CLOCK**

Real-Time Clock interfacing or clock logic implementation to maintain time using software or hardware RTC modules.
